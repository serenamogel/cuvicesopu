You get&nbsp;Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers&nbsp;from 2014.</p><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=772 data-injectable=true>Produced by legendary studio Toei Animation, this anime focuses on a group of kids called Akira, Hikaru, Edward, Chris, and Jessica. When Iron Man invents a digital prison to store and rehabilitate supervillains dubbed DISK, things look bright. When Loki arrives and turns the technology against the Avengers, he frees all of the villains and locks most of the heroes in the DISKs.&nbsp;The kids, however, end up with special Bio-Codes that allow them to summon a hero trapped inside a DISK for a short period. Using this skill, the kids find a way to free all of the Avengers and take down Loki for good.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>What makes&nbsp;Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers&nbsp;stand out is how original it is. While it isn’t canon to the modern Marvel universe, the format is different from anything seen before or since.
