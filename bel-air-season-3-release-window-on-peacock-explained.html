The Peacock series had big shoes to fill, as it was trying to put a gritty spin on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, one of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved sitcoms of all time</a>, and it managed to pull it off. The first season earned positive reviews from critics, and the second season even earned three NAACP Image nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>Fans were undoubtedly thrilled when Bel-Air was renewed, becoming Peacock’s most viewed original series and the first to reach three seasons. The celebration was short-lived, however, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> has confirmed that Bel-Air will be delayed indefinitely due to the ongoing writers and actors strike.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>It was only a matter of time. Bel-Air joins the countless other shows that have had to be pushed back due to the lack of talent working on them. Hollywood has, up to this point, refused to meet the demands of writers and actors, and as such, studios have had to rely on reality competitions and game shows to fill the void left by scripted dramas.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Those keeping up with the strike shouldn’t be surprised. Carla Banks Waddles, the showrunner and executive producer of Bel-Air season 2, has posted Instagram photos of herself on the picket line, with the caption: “Writers supporting writers.” She has not publicly spoken on the show’s delay, but one of the stars, Coco Jones, shed light on the situation during an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RNB Philly</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Carla (@cmwaddles)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Jones, who plays Hillary Banks, told the host that the episodes for the upcoming season have yet to be written. “We haven’t started filming it yet,” she revealed. “As soon as everybody meets, and everyone gets happy with the situation, then I’m sure that they’ll start the process of writing season three. I don’t know what that timeline looks like, though.”</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>While the exact timing of the release is currently unknown, it’s looking like Bel-Air will return some time next year. Pushing it back will give the writers and actors time to work on the show without feeling rushed, or relying on filler to boost the episode count. Once their demands are met by the studios, of course.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Olly Sholotan, who plays Carlton, told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Beast</a> that he felt season two managed to improve on season one, and is eager to explore more of his character in the future. “At the end of the day, it’s about telling the story,” he reasoned. “And I know that no matter what decision the writers make, I trust them to tell an incredible story. So I’m willing to put myself and my character’s life in their hands.”</p><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>Waddles also teased more screen time for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey</a> (Jimmy Akingbola), the Banks family butler. “In season three, I think we hope to fulfill the wishes of learning a little bit more about Geoffrey by giving the fans a little more information about his East London life and what that life was like before he came to Bel-Air,” the showrunner told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TheWrap</a>. “Probably seeing a little bit of that East London life come to Bel-Air a little bit and just see how he’s going to deal with it.”</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=52 data-injectable=false>We can’t wait to see it all come together in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yjsctmmKKqXaiyor%2FOp2RsZaKauaat0p5ksKGemby4ec6nZKmdkZi8pLeMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miss-minutes-vehemently-denies-giving-away-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-spoilers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miss Minutes vehemently denies giving away Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania spoilers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./an-utterly-irrelevant-remake-that-tanked-at-the-box-office-gets-in-too-deep-playing-both-sides-on-streaming.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>An utterly irrelevant remake that tanked at the box office gets in too deep playing both sides on st</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
