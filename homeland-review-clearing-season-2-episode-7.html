With the lagging thread of Dana’s story finally rejoining the main plot, we see what the effect of her relationship with Finn has given us: a reason for Brody to turn once again. In arguably the most experimental episode yet, “The Clearing” is the start of <strong>Homeland’s</strong> answer to the question of Brody’s allegiance.</p><p data-characters=598 data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true>What you might ask is what am I getting at here? I’ll explain. The initial premise of the show was determining whether or not Brody had turned. When it was revealed he had in the middle of last season, the premise was still relevant as no one but the viewers knew. We also learned of the reason Brody had decided to work for al-Qaeda; because a little boy named Issa gave him a reason to live and a reason to believe the enemy he was fighting was no more than human. He also gave Brody a reason to hate: corruption in the land of the free so vile that a former Marine would betray his county.</p><p data-characters=463 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=true>In this episode, history is repeating itself. Instead of working for the Marines, he now works for the CIA and instead of the covering up by Walden of the drone strike on innocent children, Walden is now covering up the killing of an innocent woman. Everything is happening yet again, but in a smaller scale. In case it isn’t obvious yet, my assumption is that Brody will turn yet again in this season’s finale, effectively restarting the whole cycle.</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>Of course I could be totally wrong – and I might be – but how could it not turn the way I imagine it would? After seven episodes of Dana frolicking with her boyfriend while a terrorist attack was on the horizon, we finally see just what the showrunners had planned for her all along. The whole point of Dana’s story was the eventual reveal of deep corruption on the American side. Brody turned before because of the same corruption, what makes you think he won’t turn again?</p><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>As a U.S. Marine Sergeant, Brody’s life had always been about what is right, not what is loyal. With that in mind, it isn’t a surprise that Dana feels the same way as her secret was eating her up from the inside just like Brody was when he was trying to hide his own secret. With Dana’s storyline this season coming to an end, we understand how masterful <strong>Homeland</strong> is made.</p><p data-characters=32 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>Click below to continue reading.</p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu8yeo5qmlGK%2FpsLInq5mm5yarrO1zaBkrJ2RqLyveZFmnKmho6SxpnmWaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./spider-punks-official-playlist-is-everything-we-need-after-across-the-spider-verse.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Spider-Punks official playlist is everything we need after Across the Spider-Verse</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-lundin-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Lundin Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
