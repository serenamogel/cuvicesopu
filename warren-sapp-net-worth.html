Warren Sapp is probably best known for his 13-season career in the NFL, and he earned quite a reputation for himself as a defensive tackle. During his playing career, he played predominantly for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Celebrated and derided in equal parts for his hard-hitting style of play, Warren proved a divisive figure in the NFL. At times, Sapp became verbally abusive to players, and he got himself into various controversies over the course of his career. In 1999, he was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Unfortunately, Warren's finances have suffered after he left the NFL. After earning nearly $60 million in NFL salary alone, in 2012 <a href=#>Warren declared bankruptcy</a>. In his filing he reported $6 million worth of debt.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Warren Carr Sapp was born on December 19th of 1972 in Orlando, Florida. He was subsequently raised in Plymouth, Florida by his single mother. Sapp's athletic potential became clear after he joined his school football team at Apopka High School. During this period, he played tight end, linebacker, punter, and placekicker. During these early years, Sapp set numerous records, including most tackles for a loss, most sacks, the longest field goal. He also played basketball for his high school.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Warren played as a defensive standout at the University of Miami. His coach quickly converted him into a defensive lineman, a decision that helped him win multiple awards. These included the Bronko Nagurski Trophy in 1994 for Best Defensive Player, the Rotary Lombardi Award for Best Lineman, and the Bill Willis Award for Best Defensive Lineman.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In the first round of the 1995 NFL draft, Sapp was picked at the 12th overall selection by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He held the position of right defensive tackle for his entire stay in Tampa. His first season was quite promising, with one interception and 27 tackles. This made him the top tackler for the Buccaneers. In 1996, he recorded 51 tackles and 9 sacks, an impressive sum which he managed to improve upon notably in 1997.</p><p>On March 20, 2004, Sapp had agreed to a 7-year contract with the Oakland Raiders worth $36.6 million. In 16 games with the Raiders, he recorded 30 tackles, 2.5 sacks, and 2 fumble recoveries, playing both defensive end and defensive tackle. The next season, Sapp reverted back to his defensive tackle position, starting the first 10 games and racking up 29 tackles and 5 sacks. He was sidelined for the last 6 games of the season due to a shoulder injury but returned in 2006 with 10 sacks and 32 tackles.</p><p>During the 2007 season, Warren recorded 37 tackles and 2 sacks. However, he was later ejected on December 23 after an altercation with officials during a game in Jacksonville.</p><p>On March 4, 2008, Sapp confirmed that he was retiring.</p><p>Sapp was one of the only 12 defensive players in the NFL to ever make the Pro Bowl, win a Super Bowl NFL title, and be honored as Defensive Player of the Year at the time of his retirement. He participated in 7 Pro Bowls and was named a first-team All-Pro and second-team All-Pro 4 and 2 times respectively. He was named Defensive Player of the Year after his 1999 season.</p><h2 id=contracts-career-earnings><strong>Contracts and Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>In 1998 Warren Sapp had signed a contract extension that granted him $36 million over 6 years. On March 20, 2004, Sapp had agreed to a 7-year contract with the Oakland Raiders for $36.6 million. He did not play out that full contract, retiring in 2008. In total during his career Warren Sapp earned $58 million in NFL salary alone.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316487 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Warren-Sapp-1.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316487 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=controversy><strong>Controversy</strong></h2><p>During a 2002 game at Raymond James Stadium, Sapp inflicted a serious pelvic injury on <a href=# title="Chad Clifton Net Worth">Chad Clifton</a> of the Green Bay Packers. The hit left Clifton hospitalized for about a week, and it affected his ability to walk for several weeks afterward. A heated confrontation between Warren and the coach for the Packers was caught on camera after the incident. It showed Sapp verbally abusing the coach after he approached him about the hit.</p><p>Another controversy involved Sapp disrupting a football game warmup against the Pittsburgh Steelers. A heated argument broke out between Warren and <a href=# title="Jerome Bettis Net Worth">Jerome Bettis</a> after Jerome shoved Sapp. He was not fined for this incident. A similar incident occurred in 2003, when Sapp was scolded for disrupting a Colts warmup. Not long afterward, Sapp ran onto the field and bumped into an NFL referee before a game against the Washington Redskins. He was fined $50,000.</p><p>In 2007, he was ejected from a game for a verbal altercation. It all began from a penalty dispute, eventually landing Sapp three unsportsmanlike conduct penalties after he mouthed off at officials repeatedly. The NFL fined Sapp $75,000.</p><h2 id=legal-trouble><strong>Legal Trouble</strong></h2><p>Sapp was arrested in South Florida on February 7, 2010, for domestic battery. The charges were eventually dropped.</p><p>The day after the Super Bowl on February 2, 2015, he was arrested again for suspicion of soliciting a prostitute and assault. His contract with the NFL Network had been dropped at this point. The charges were dismissed in May of the same year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-157442 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Warren-Sapp.jpg alt="Warren Sapp Net Worth" width=594 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-157442 class=wp-caption-text>Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images</p><h2 id=bankruptcy><strong>Bankruptcy</strong></h2><p>2010 proved to be the start of a very rough time for Sapp. PNC Bank was awarded a judgment of $988,691.99, and in 2011 filed a monthly lieu of $33,333 against Warren's NFL Network paycheck of $45,000. He owed money to the International Revenue Service, alimony and child support payments, unpaid property taxes, and various attorneys and friends. This all formed a massive debt of over $1.8 million.</p><p>In April 2012 <a href=#>Sapp filed for bankruptcy</a>. In the filing he claimed to have lost his Buccaneer Super Bowl ring, as well as his University of Miami championship rings. By 2012, <a href=#>his debts added up to $6.7 million</a>, against his assets which were valued at $6.45 million.</p><h2 id=florida-mansion><strong>Florida Mansion</strong></h2><p>Due to his bankruptcy, Sapp was forced to sell his 15,162 square-foot luxury home in Windermere, Florida. The property was at one time valued at $7 million. Unfortunately it was sold at auction for just $2.9 million in November 2012. Here is a video tour of Warren's former Florida mansion from when it was listed years later:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6e4jrCYq6qVo3q0rc%2BpZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adam-tambellini.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adam Tambellini- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./industry-season-release-date-cast-plot-predictions-trailer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Industry Season 3: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer, And Everything That You Want To Know!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
