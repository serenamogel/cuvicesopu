Walter Payton’s cherished 1979 Porsche 930 Turbo fetched a whopping $324,500, plus buyer’s fee, in an auction this weekend at the Schaumburg Convention Center.</strong></p><p>The winning bid was made online and the car is headed to California, according to a spokesman for Mecum Auctions. The name of the buyer was not disclosed.</p><p>Payton, the legendary Bears running back, bought the car new in 1979 and it was the jewel of his collection, according to his son, Jarrett, who inherited the car after his father’s death in 1999. The car was just one of 1,200 930 Turbo models produced for the U.S. market in 1979.</p><p><strong>The Porsche was the first big-time sports car Payton purchased. He was 25, and well on his way to stardom five years into his NFL career.</strong></p><p>“He got into the league in ’75,” Jarrett explained in a press release for Mecum, “and early on, his main focus was just playing football. He worked hard to ensure he had established himself, so when he was getting to the good part of his career when the ’80s came around, he wanted to treat himself.”</p><p><strong>Payton went on to amass a small collection of supercars and also took up competitive racing after his football career. But he held a special place in his heart for the powerhouse silver Porsche.</strong></p><p>“I just remember how much time he would spend with the car and being around the car,” Jarrett said, though the car has fewer than 10,000 miles on it.</p><p>“As he started getting more cars, it really just became his baby. So he’d admire it and take it out for short periods of time. For him, it was so special that it was like another kid. He had me and my sister (Brittney) and then this Porsche.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jarrett-payton-retiring-on-his-terms></span>Jarrett Payton Retiring on His Terms<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>In 2010 Jarrett left football. He took advantage of small business opportunities and broadcasting but there was something he was missing.</strong></p><p>The ONE reoccurring thing on the “life after football” list was his idea to give back to the community. From a very early age, his mother, Connie, and father, Walter, taught Jarrett and his sister, Brittney, the value of giving back and how fortunate they could use their Payton family name in helping others.</p><p>The “life after football” list was finally coming to fruition. Over the years Jarrett had done a lot in the community, but he wanted to move forward with making a difference for an organization with his name on it.</p><p>Trisha often times says, “Jarrett will walk into an event being known as Walter Payton’s son, but he will be remembered when he leaves the room as Jarrett Payton.” That was his goal. He wanted to be remembered for his passionate work in the community.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-jarrett-payton></span>Frequently Asked Questions About <strong>Jarrett Payton</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-jarrett-payton></span>Who is <strong>Jarrett Payton</strong>?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jarrett Payton is a famous former American football running back who was born in Arlington Heights, Illinois, the United States as Jarrett Walter Payton.
