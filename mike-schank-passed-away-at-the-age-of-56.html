On social media, filmmaker Edgar Wright paid homage to Schank, writing:</p><p>‚ÄúMike Schank, the lovely and hilarious person at the center of the wonderful documentary ‚ÄòAmerican Movie,‚Äô has died. We were captivated by it, and because Mike‚Äôs home phone number was available on the DVD extras, we contacted him from London one night. If you haven‚Äôt watched it yet, please do so right now.‚Äù</p><h2>Mike Schank was afflicted with cancer.</h2><p>Mike died in his mother‚Äôs arms on Thursday morning, according to the Milwaukee Record. The reason of death, however, was not immediately known.&nbsp;It should be emphasized that Schank was diagnosed with cancer in June 2022 and was in the latter stages of the disease at the time. He announced the news on Facebook, writing:</p><p>‚ÄúI was just diagnosed with a rare kind of cancer. It began in my esophagus and progressed to my liver, lungs, and a variety of other organs. It‚Äôs stage 4, and they won‚Äôt be able to cure it, but they will attempt to manage it with radiation and chemotherapy.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mike-Schank-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, it is uncertain if cancer had a factor in his demise.
