Even his personal life and failed marriages — including his marriage to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Marie Presley</a> — also attracted widespread tabloid and popular attention.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>While everything about the pop legend is public knowledge, there are various aspects that have barely been touched upon and one of them is his educational background. Here’s what we all need to know about Jackson’s education, his childhood, and which schools he attended.</p><h2 id=h-all-about-michael-jackson-childhood-and-education data-injectable=false><strong>All about Michael Jackson: childhood and education</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Michael-Jackson.png><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>On August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, Jackson was born into a large family with eight siblings – five brothers and three sisters. He was exposed to show business in 1964 when he joined the band Jackson Brothers, aka Jackson 5, as a backup musician with his brothers.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>The band went on to achieve an incredible amount of recognition with the passing years. MJ‘s musical prowess received quite a lot of attention. Later on, he sang vocals on the cover of the famous song by The Temptations, “Only Girl,” and by 1969, the family band received international acclaim, catapulting Jackson into stardom and endless fame thereafter.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Growing up, life wasn’t easy for the pop star and his brothers, who were reportedly abused by their father even for the smallest infractions. Michael describes his childhood as “lonely and isolated,” which impacted him deeply later in his life.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>In addition to the numerous facets of his life, Jackson’s education and schooling have sparked curiosity among his fans. For someone who spent a significant time during his childhood performing and recording music, many assumed Michael to have been home-schooled.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>However, this isn’t true. It is believed that he attended the public school in his hometown, Gary. He was enrolled in school until the age of 11, after which he and his brothers had to drop out because of their constant tours and regular performances – but this doesn’t mean that he discontinued his education.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>Instead, a private tutor named Rose Fine was hired for him. Later, Michael credited his love of books to Fine. He owned a total of 10,000 books of every genre ranging from literature and novels to history and politics. The “Billie Jean” singer was also known to read and finish one book each day, which is reflective of years of knowledge that he accumulated over the years.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=false>While we will always remember the “King of Pop” for his enormous contribution to music, his childhood and education also played a significant role in shaping his persona.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnmSdoZRiuqqvx5qcpWWalrCsv86nZKCnXam8br%2FCoaaopF2itqS0wJ6jZqKRmLi0u82sZJ6cpZiutbXOp2SesKChrqq6xJ1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-intel-core-i3-7350k-60w-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gaming: GRID Autosport - The Intel Core i3-7350K (60W) Review: Almost a Core i7-2600K</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jme-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>JME Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
