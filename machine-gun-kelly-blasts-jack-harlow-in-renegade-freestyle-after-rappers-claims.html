Notable stars on the mic include the late Mac Miller, Lil’ Dicky, <a href=#>Machine Gun Kelly</a>, and most recently, Jack Harlow.</p><p>In a song from <a href=#>Harlow’s new album</a>, Jackman, Harlow recently proclaimed himself the “hardest white boy” behind Eminem, prompting MGK to call out the rapper’s claim.</p><p>MGK, who recently released pop punk rock music, fired off a new freestyle rap track with several notable dis lines aimed at the First Class rapper.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-machine-gun-kelly-drops-renegade-freestyle-with-lines-aimed-at-jack-harlow>Machine Gun Kelly drops Renegade Freestyle with lines aimed at Jack Harlow</h2><p>Machine Gun Kelly made good use of the beat for Jay-Z’s classic song Renegade, which also featured Eminem as a guest rapper. In MGK’s version, he went off for over two minutes and seemed to be aiming at naysayers, doubters, and rivals.</p><p>One portion of MGK’s fiery freestyle went straight for Harlow’s jugular, following the rapper’s claims on Jackman.</p><p>“I see why they called you Jack man/ you jacked man’s whole swag, give Drake his flow back man,” MGK raps in the latter half of his freestyle.</p><p>MGK also throws in a recent sports reference, comparing his rivals or haters to former Memphis Grizzlies player Dillon Brooks. The NBA player famously made remarks to doubt NBA superstar <a href=#>LeBron James</a> while amid a playoff battle with James’ Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>“Look at all you little Dillon Brooks/ I don’t care if I’m older, I’m colder you poked the bear in the woods/ Come back like LeBron and drop 40 on you like I should,” he raps.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>MGK’s lines about Harlow come just over a week after Harlow released his third studio album, Jackman. The release was a surprise as Harlow revealed it was on the way just days ahead of dropping it for the masses.</p><p>In his song They Don’t Love It, Harlow makes a reference to Eminem, bringing up the rapper’s famous line from his hit song Lose Yourself, which appeared on the 8 Mile Soundtrack.</p><p>“Ya boy’s strivin’ to be the most dominant ever / The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters / And hold the comments ‘cause I promise you I’m honestly better than whoever came to your head right then,” Harlow raps.</p><p>Eminem hasn’t officially responded to what Harlow said, and based on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NME’s report</a>, Harlow considers Em an icon. However, it appears MGK took exception to Harlow’s bars, prompting him to fire off some of what he said in the Renegade freestyle.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Speculation continues about MGK and Megan Fox’s relationship</h2><p>Just a few months ago, rumors popped up that Megan Fox and MGK were having issues with their relationship. The two have been engaged since January 2022, with Monsters and Critics reporting news about their <a href=#>unique engagement outdoors</a>.</p><p>Over Super Bowl weekend, the two attended a party together. However, things went awry from there. Fox deleted all Instagram photos with MGK in them and then temporarily deactivated her profile, even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hinting at GK’s infidelity</a>.</p><p>Fox eventually returned to social media, but in the past week, speculation has continued as the two haven’t attended specific events together. That included the <a href=#>Bupkis premiere</a>, where MGK supported his good friend Pete Davidson. In addition, <a href=#>MGK had a solo birthday party</a> sans his fiancee Fox.</p><p>In late March, a report from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> citing an unidentified source close to the couple said they were in “therapy,” but it was unlikely they’d be able to repair their relationship.</p><p>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ report</a> in early April revealed MGK and Fox having dinner in Hawaii, with the rapper sporting a new hairstyle and some PDA between the two. However, as of early May, it remains unclear if these two are attempting to mend differences, giving each other time apart, or just about to call it quits.</p><p>It’s entirely possible a rough relationship or impending breakup is what fueled MGK’s recent flamethrower freestyle dis aimed at Harlow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6cnKWdkqe2tcWOppicoJmjsm6z1KdkpJ2cocZursuaqq2rXZ%2BupLeMoZirpJ%2Bseqq6jKucp52XlrGmecWrnJ6rpK65pnnAn6ueql2nrrG8xKuqZpuclrauv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tim-finchems-2022-net-worth-is-more-than-7-million-how-rich-is-he-249089-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tim Finchems 2022 Net Worth Is More Than $7 Million -How Rich Is He?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-conrad-parents-sister-kids-parents-career-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Conrads Parents: Sister, Kids, Parents Career ,Net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
