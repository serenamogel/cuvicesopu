We are bound to catch a lot of celebrities including previous bachelor and bachelorettes in the finale party including the ‘The Bachelorette’ 2016 Jojo Fletcher and her beau Jordan Rogers. Let us take a flash back to look at the hot and sexy Jojo Rogers and her love life.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1656 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jojo-Fletcher-and-Jordan-Rodgers.jpg alt="Jojo Fletcher and Jordan Rodgers Engagement" width=600 height=391 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p style=text-align:center><strong>Source:People</strong></p><h3>Her Body and measurements</h3><p>Jojo Fletcher is without a doubt is one of the hottest bachelorettes in the history of the show. She had appeared in the 2016 Bachelor as a contestant where she lost in the finale. This was good in a way because shortly after she became ‘The Bachelorette’ and received an entire change in her life and career. After all, why try to find a King when you yourself are a queen.</p><p>It is in ‘The Bachelorette’ where we saw the steamy version of the 27-year-old. She had several photo shoots before the show and her bold bikini photo shoots were what caught the attention of everybody. ‘dailymail’ reported one of her raunchy photo-shoots where she was seen wearing a skimpy bikini pairing it up with daisy dukes shorts and a loose blue cardigan.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1658 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jojo-Fletcher.jpg alt="Hot Jojo Fletcher" width=600 height=832 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p style=text-align:center><strong>Source:<a class="_ZR irc_hol i3724" tabindex=0 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-noload data-ved=0ahUKEwjZtf_su-jUAhVKOo8KHcQZDXwQjB0IBg><span class=irc_ho dir=ltr>pinterest.com</span></a></strong></p><p>Jojo also seemed confident and not a bit shy being around cameras and people. Why should she when she has a body of a goddess. She weighs approximately 130 pounds to her short height of 5’4”. She has a perfect dress and shoe size of 6 and 8 respectively, a reason why she always looked so gorgeous in the show. She has an almost perfect body size of 37-26-37 (the common belief being 36-24-36).</p><p>One of the most eye-catching things about her in the show always has been her busts especially when she wore a lot of cleavage revealing dresses. Her bust is one her best bodily features that are the size of 34 C. So her body measurements clearly show her as a sexy woman.</p><h2>Troubled Relations with her Ex-Boyfriend:</h2><p>It was already revealed in ‘The Bachelor’ by the show’s host, Chris Harrison that Jojo had freshly broken up with her ex-boyfriend, Chad Rookstool. The viewers of the show might remember the episode where Jojo received flowers and letter from Chad in the midst of the show’s shooting. Jojo who was expecting the flowers to be from the season’s Bachelor Ben Haggins was very disappointed and upset to find it was from her former flame.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-1660 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebliveupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jojo-Fletcher-Chad-Rookstool.jpg alt="Jojo Fletcher And Chad Rookstool Relationship" width=600 height=656 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p style=text-align:center><strong>Source:<a class="_ZR irc_hol i3724" tabindex=0 href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-noload data-ved=0ahUKEwjKuu7ZwOjUAhUMo48KHRJ2CTcQjB0IBg><span class=irc_ho dir=ltr>The Hollywood Gossip</span></a></strong></p><p>The incident nearly cost her elimination from the show then and there judging from Ben’s reaction to it. However Ben moved on and the event was not talked about ever since. However, the past caught up with her when again during ‘The Bachelorette’, her ex-boyfriend Chad’s interview came out in the ‘In Touch Weekly’. There he made remarks about his relationship with Jojo and gave statements like,</p><p>“As soon as she got home, we started hanging out every day and being intimate again. We were sneaking around the whole time The Bachelor was airing because she wasn’t allowed to be seen with me”</p><p>Jojo talked about it with other contestants in tears and fairly upset assuring them that no such things happened. They were in contact but had no intimate feelings behind it. She must have felt that they had a clean break-up and could get along as friends considering he was watching her dog while she was doing the show.</p><p>Jojo Fletcher’s Ex-boyfriend Chad Rookstool is a successful salon owner and hairdresser with 17 years’ experience in the field. He owns the ‘Chad Rookstool’ salon in Dallas, Texas that offers color, styling, hair treatments, makeup and wedding services. He has also trained under great names like French stylist Jean-Philippe.</p><h4>Her Short Bio:</h4><p>However, this was a long time back. Currently, her love life couldn’t be any happier. As we all know that she is engaged to her fiancé Jordon Rogers, brother of famous football player Aaron Rogers after she gave him the final rose. They have recently hit a one-year milestone in their relationship and judging by their pics on Instagram, they are looking to go together for a lifetime.</p><p>Jojo Fletcher was born on November 1, 1990, in Dallas, Texas, US. She is into the business of real estate and has been running her own firm, HF Realty Development for 2 years which together with her celebrity status has earned her an astounding net worth anticipated for being 200,000 dollars. Her fiancé to being a former footballer and a minor celebrity has a great net worth anticipated to be 1.5 million dollars.</p><p>For now, Jojo seems to be in the correct place and time alongside fiancée Jordan. Their relationship seems to be growing stronger and stronger unlike the other couples of the show. For now, they are enjoying their time together. Like their fans and supporters, we are also looking forward to hearing married plans from the couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7jIr5yuqJSWwaZ6wqikaK%2BYpMButs6jpmaenJrBpLTEq2SesF2XvLqy0aKcp5xdlrm0u4ympqudXZavsMHTZp%2Beql2dvLV5waibsmWdmq60wdGepJ6mpKh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-akiko-iwase-everything-to-know-about-the-cast-of-minamata.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Akiko Iwase?
