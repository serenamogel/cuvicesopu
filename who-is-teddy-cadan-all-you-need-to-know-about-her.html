After four years of dating, the couple married in 2018.&nbsp;The husband and wife are enjoying a happy marriage with their daughter Teddy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Teddy-Cadan.jpg><h2>Her Siblings</h2><p>She has one brother from her mother’s previous marriage to Peter Paul Loughran, a hairdresser and singer. Wylie Elliot Loughran, her older brother, stays with her.</p><h2>Relationship with Her Mother</h2><p>Lena, like her Game of Thrones character, loves her children to infinity. The daughter and mother have a good relationship. She likes spending time with her mum and doing wacky stuff. The two may be seen enjoying a wild time together. Teddy has dressed up as a pirate, and her mother has painted herself as a cat.</p><p>Her mother sent her a heartfelt note before her birth. She wrote,&nbsp;“My daughter will have the freedom to choose.” She will be free to dance, sing, and be educated in subjects that interest her, to marry if she wants, to marry WHO she wants, to stay single, or to fall in love with another woman.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Teddy-Cadan-2.jpg><p>In an interview with Mother, James Cordon praised Lean Headey for her iconic ‘Walk of Shame’ during the last season of her show Game of Thrones.’ He was intrigued by her admirers’ reaction after that scene and those moments. People have been friendly and a little judgemental, according to Lena. Concerning being judgemental, she said that she had her second kid, Teddy Cadan and that while she was in the hospital, there was a nice nurse who would come and do the night shift and was a huge fan of the series and her part as ‘Cersei.’</p><p>Her child had jaundice, so she nursed her to calm her down on a Billy Bed with lights. Lena explained how early breastfeeding requires manual milking. Lena agreed to exchange as her husband wasn’t much help. As the nurse caressed her breast, she whispered, “Shame.” Lena was shocked and repeated it. The nurse couldn’t believe she said it.</p><h2>Her Net Worth</h2><p>She is too young to have a personal net worth. However, she lives a luxury lifestyle thanks to <strong>her mother’s $12 million net worth as of August 2023.</strong> She began her career as a supporting actor, appearing in films including Waterland, Century, and The Remains of the Day.&nbsp;She featured in major films such as Mrs. Dalloway, Brother Grimm, 300, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, and others.&nbsp;Although she has acted in a variety of minor and large productions, the HBO fantasy series The Game of Thrones was the one that catapulted her to popularity.</p><p>She was originally paid $150000 each episode for the series. Her pay for each episode grew as the series became more famous throughout the globe. She was paid $500000 each episode in seasons 5 and 6. Similarly, she received $1.1 million for each episode of 14 events between July 2017 and May 2019.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Teddy was born on July 10, 2015.
