His "<a href=#>Henry V</a>" was a Shakespeare history filled with patriotism and poetry. His "<a href=#>Dead Again</a>" hurtled headlong into the juiciness of the murder-and-reincarnation genre. His "<a href=#>Peter's Friends</a>" was a reunion of old university chums whose youthful quirks had matured into full-blown eccentricities, for good or ill. That last film, oddly enough, has a tone somewhat in common with "Much Ado About Nothing." The play, set in Sicily and shot in Tuscany, involves a few crucial days in the lives of the followers of Don Pedro (<a href=#>Denzel Washington</a>), Prince of Arragon, who returns victorious from battle with his half-brother Don John (<a href=#>Keanu Reeves</a>). They are now apparently on speaking terms, but Don John, wearing a wicked black beard, mopes about the edges of the screen, casting dark looks upon the merrymakers.</p><p>Claudio (<a href=#>Robert Sean Leonard</a>), Don Pedro's follower, casts eyes on the beautiful Hero (<a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a>) and is immediately possessed by love. Her eyes reveal that she reciprocates. Meanwhile, the older Benedick (Branagh) and Beatrice (<a href=#>Emma Thompson</a>) feel a powerful attraction, too, but it is expressed through barbed insults and verbal sparring. Sometimes when people are frightened by the love they feel, it comes out through mock hostility.</p><p>The film's action is a progression through a series of picnics, communal bathing, dinners, banquets, dances and courtships.</p><p>Branagh sets the pace just this side of a Marx Brothers movie. While Benedick and Beatrice do their best to assure that they will never become a couple, the scheming Don John plots to destroy the love that has bloomed for Claudio and Hero. His evil plan involves the use of impostors to convince Claudio that Hero is a wanton woman, unfaithful to him with any man who comes to hand.</p><p>A play like "Much Ado About Nothing" is all about style. I doubt if Shakespeare's audiences at the Globe took it any more seriously than we do. It is farce and mime and wisecracks, and dastardly melodrama which all comes right in the end, of course, because this is a Comedy. The key to the film's success is in the acting, especially in the sparks that fly between Branagh and Thompson as their characters aim their insults so lovingly that we realize, sooner than they do, how much they would miss their verbal duets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mrJygXZaxsHnAm6aurF2jvLW0yKeeZmlpboA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./152512-video-massive-snake-water-people-vowing-swim-river-again.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Snake in Water Goes TikTok Viral With 4.9M Views, Video of Anaconda Has Peeps Vowing to Never Swim A</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-abomination-stronger-than-hulk.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Abomination stronger than Hulk?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
