The Cripes, a toothy, voracious race of interstellar garbage disposal units, have landed on Earth. They are followed here by bounty hunters, who blast them down with weapons that look as if they were made out of old tail pipes. The bounty hunters can assume the appearance of actual human beings, which means that the producers didn't have to spend any extra money on special makeup; all they had to do was hire an actor and say that he was an alien.</p><p>Anyway, the Cripes attack the same town they attacked the first time around. And the movie attacks the same plot it attacked the first time around, right down to the cantankerous local sheriff and the townspeople who band together to fight the invasion. But while the first movie had considerable wit, this one is a demoralized enterprise from beginning to end. And it particularly misses the presence of M. Emmet Walsh, who played the sheriff in the first film with his usual oily charm.</p><p>Which leads me to a helpful suggestion: In the case of a movie like "Critters 2," the story is by definition utterly inconsequential.</p><p>The only element from the original movie that interests the financial backers is the title. Since "Critters 2" can be used as a title by anyone who holds the copyright to "Critters," and the title alone will lure people into the theater, why bother with a mere retread? Why not have some fun? My suggestion for "Critters 3": Make it a satire on sleazoid critter movies, starring the hapless and unseen employees who operate the hand puppets. Take us backstage. Show us the crummy special effects, but make fun of them. Pillory the crass financial guys who cynically demand a no-brainer remake. Make the hero a bright young film school grad who dreams that his version of "Critters" will win an Oscar.</p><p>Opportunities for satire are everywhere. In "Critters 2" there is an amazingly bad sequence in which all of the critters roll themselves up into one gigantic ball and roll out to flatten the town. Anyone reading this review would write a funny scene about the difficulties of manufacturing and operating a critter ball. What is it made out of? Does it smell? Do the local dogs have a tendency to pay it rude visits? What happens if you're an extra who has to be crushed by the hairy ball and you have severe allergies? And so on, right down to the pecking order between puppeteers who operate the critters who are stars, and others who are relegated to the obscure critters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cqaKspJq%2FtHmRZquhnV2irqq6jJymrqqjmnpyhZdx</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garcelle-beauvais-nilon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./aew-star-pokes-fun-at-notorious-cm-punk-brawl-at-all-in.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>AEW Star Pokes Fun at Notorious CM Punk Brawl at All In</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
