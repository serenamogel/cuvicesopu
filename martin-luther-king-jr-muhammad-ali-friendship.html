The 10-round boxing match was the young boxer’s seventh, but his swagger and charm had already gained him admirers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That day, the man who would soon become <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/muhammad-ali data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Muhammad Ali" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Muhammad Ali</a> received a telegram from an unexpected correspondent. “Your youthful good humor, physical prowess, and flippant charm have made you an idol to many American young people,” it read. “May God protect you and your opponent in the coming contest.” It was signed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/martin-luther-king-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Martin Luther King Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Martin Luther King Jr.</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was an overture to an unlikely friendship, one that took place on the stormy stage of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/civil-rights-movement data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil Rights Movement" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Though it is uncertain how many times MLK and Ali met during their lifetimes, they were friends.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But publicly, the two men couldn’t have been more opposed — and their secret friendship was only revealed to the public through surveillance files that showed the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/us-government/fbi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=FBI class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">FBI</a> had long been following them.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Despite their differences, King and Ali had a strong bond</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The bond between King and Ali was surprising: Ali was the world’s most famous boxer, and an outspoken member of the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://blackpast.org/aah/nation-islam-1930 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nation of Islam" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Nation of Islam</a>, a Black separatist group that preached non-integration and revolution. That was the opposite of King’s ideals of nonviolent protest and integration.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the 1960s, the men found themselves on two different sides of a growing rift between King’s Civil Rights Movement, on the one hand, and the NOI’S turbulent vision of Black power, on the other.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the men had much in common. Both had grown up in the segregated South. They were arguably the two most famous Black men in America — King for his protests and preaching, Ali for his astonishing athleticism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">And by the end of the 1960s, they were two of the most hated men in the United States, too. Racists branded them both with ugly stereotypes. They decried King’s insistence on the dignity and worth of Black men and his agitation on behalf of the poor, and derided Ali’s insistence on Black pride, from his name change in 1964 to his resistance to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vietnam War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Vietnam War</a> as a white man’s fight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Publicly, the men could not seem more opposed. “Integration is wrong,” Ali said in 1964 when King was at the height of his visibility for nonviolent protests and calls to integrate Black people into a white-dominated society. “White people don’t want it, the Muslims don’t want it... I don’t join integration marches and I never hold a sign.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, King repeatedly <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/elijah-muhammad-0 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=declined class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">declined</a> to engage with the Nation of Islam and<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/01/14/martin-luther-king-jr-met-malcolm-x-just-once-the-photo-still-haunts-us-with-what-was-lost/?utm_term=.c46407b03a14" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" turned down" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> turned down</a> an invitation by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/malcolm-x data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm X" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Malcolm X</a>, the NOI’s most visible figure, to march together. “I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views,” King said later.</p><img alt="Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X" title="Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X" width=2151 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/muhammad-ali_malcolm-x_gettyimages-97296114.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: John Peodincuk/NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images</span><p>Muhammad Ali with Black Muslim leader Malcolm X in New York City, 1964</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He may just as well have been speaking of Ali. But ironically, the issue that made Ali one of the most hated Black men in America brought both men together. In 1966, Ali announced that he would refuse to serve in the Vietnam War. “Man, I ain’t got no quarrel with them Viet Cong,” he<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/02/19/1968-project-muhammad-ali-vietnam-war/334759002/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> said</a>. To Ali, the war was both unethical and not his to fight.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">King supported Ali even when the boxer evaded the draft</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That decision ignited a tinderbox. The war was already unpopular, and men around the country had begun to dodge the draft and declare themselves conscientious objectors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The United States<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-truth-about-muhammad-ali-and-the-draft-1493330969 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" tried" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> tried</a> to broker a behind-the-scenes deal with Ali, offering him a deal to allow him to serve without seeing actual combat in the hopes of avoiding his becoming a public conscientious objector. It failed, and Ali was arrested and charged with draft evasion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ali paid a heavy price for his actions: His heavyweight title and boxing license were<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/05/28/140182852.html?pageNumber=288" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" stripped" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> stripped</a> from him, leaving him unable to box and the subject of derision and hatred from those who supported the war.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But not King: He publicly supported Ali and his actions. “He’s doing what he’s doing on the basis of conscience,” he<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://observer.com/2017/04/50-years-ago-muhammad-ali-refuses-vietnam-draft/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> said</a> in a news conference. “He’s absolutely sincere. I strongly endorse his actions.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This was a change in tune for King, who had opposed the war in private but only<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/vietnam-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" addressed" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"> addressed</a> his opposition in public in 1967 after Ali took his stand.
