He won the Nobel Prize in 1905 for his work. He is considered one of the founders of microbiology and developed criteria, named Koch's postulates, that were meant to help establish a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Bacterial Discoveries</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Robert Koch has been celebrated for his research into the causes of notable diseases and presenting solutions to safeguard public health:</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Anthrax</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While employed in private practice as a physician in Wollstein, Koch set to work on identifying the root cause of the anthrax that had felled livestock in the region. By inoculating healthy animals with infected tissue, he determined the ideal environment for the anthrax bacillus to spread, including transmission through soil by spores. Koch became the first to link a specific bacterium with a specific disease, propelling him to fame with the publication of his findings in 1876.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Tuberculosis</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After moving to the the Imperial Health Office in Berlin, Koch began his work on discovery of the tubercle bacillus. He painstakingly tried out different stains to reveal the nature of the bacteria, as well as the ideal media in which to grow colonies for study. Inoculating more than 200 animals with bacilli from pure cultures, he determined that sputum was the principal source of the disease's transmission, requiring the sterilization of clothes and bed sheets from infected patients.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Koch's presentation of his findings, at a meeting of the Berlin Physiological Society in 1882, is considered a watershed moment in medical history. In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in helping to curb the spread of the deadly disease.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Cholera</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following his resounding success with TB, Koch was sent to Egypt and Calcutta, India, to investigate the outbreak of cholera in those areas. He identified the bacillus and its characteristics, though its nature as a human-borne disease made it difficult to test his research on animals. Nevertheless, Koch determined that contaminated drinking water was the primary culprit behind the spread of the disease. He again targeted drinking water as the source of an 1892 outbreak in Germany, leading to a renewed focus on that area of public health.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Pioneering Methodology</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along with his discovery of certain bacteria, Robert Koch pioneered new techniques for conducting laboratory research. He experimented with different dyes for observing bacteria and collaborated with microscope developers to foster improved resolution, becoming the first physician to use an oil immersion lens and a condenser.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Realizing that solid media was better than liquid for the development of pure cultures, Koch conducted his groundbreaking research on tuberculosis by growing bacterial colonies on sliced potatoes. He later found improved media for his experiments, with one assistant, Walther Hesse, discovering the favorable properties of agar, and another, Julius Petri, introducing his easy-to-use Petri dish.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Koch's Postulates</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the 1880s, Koch formed a checklist of conditions to be satisfied for specific bacteria to be accepted as the cause of specific diseases:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">1. The microorganism or other pathogen must be present in all cases of the disease, and not in healthy animals.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">2. The pathogen must be isolated from the diseased host and grown in pure culture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">3. The pathogen from the pure culture must cause the disease when inoculated into a healthy animal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">4. The pathogen must be reisolated from the new host and shown to be the same as the originally inoculated pathogen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These postulates were formally approved by the Great Powers in Dresden in 1893.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Early Life and Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Robert Heinrich Hermann Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in Clausthal, Germany. The son of a mining engineer, he demonstrated a gifted mind at an early age, reportedly announcing to his parents at age 5 that he had taught himself to read by using newspapers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1862, Koch enrolled at the University of Gottingen to study medicine. Among his influential professors was Jacob Henle, a leading anatomist and proponent of the germ theory of disease.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After earning his medical degree in 1866, Koch worked as a hospital assistant. He passed the district medical officer's examination, and by 1870 he began volunteering for medical service in the Franco-Prussian war. In 1872, he became district medical officer for Wollstein, where he began compiling the research on bacteria that would make him famous.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Tubercilin and Bovine TB Missteps</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1890, Koch announced that he had developed a cure for tuberculosis, called tubercilin. This prompted patients and physicians alike to travel to Berlin, and for Koch to take on a new role as director of the new Institute for Infectious Diseases. However, the so-called cure was soon revealed to have little therapeutic value, damaging Koch's reputation in the medical community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1901, Koch attended the International Tuberculosis Congress in Washington, D.C., where he argued that bovine tuberculosis was of a separate nature from the form that afflicted humans and as such was relatively harmless to men. While correct that the bacilli causing bovine TB was different, he was ultimately proven wrong in his belief that it had little effect on humans and that no public measures were needed to purge infected livestock.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Later Travels and Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Long harboring a love for travel, Koch spent much of the remaining 15 years of his life visting foreign countries to embark on new research. In the late 1890s he traveled to Rhodesia (South Africa) to help stem an outbreak of rinderpest, and he followed with stops in other parts of Africa and India to study malaria, surra and other diseases.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After stepping down as director of the Institute for Infectious Disease — later renamed the Koch Institute — in 1904, Koch returned to Africa to study trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and visited relatives in the U.S. He died of heart disease on May 27, 1910, in Baden-Baden, Germany.</p><h2 data-node-id=34 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the founders of microbiology, Koch helped usher in a "golden age" of scientific discovery which uncovered the principal bacterial pathogens behind many of the deadliest diseases known to mankind, and directly prompted the implementation of life-saving public health measures. Additionally, his postulates and laboratory techniques served as a bedrock for medicinal developments that lasted well into the 20th century.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Koch's most influential scientific papers were finally published in English in 1987, and the following year, Thomas Brock delivered an acclaimed biography, Robert Koch: A Life in Medicine and Bacteriology.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On December 10, 2017, Google celebrated the 112th anniversary of Koch's Nobel Prize win with one of its celebrated "Google Doodles."</p><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li>Name: Robert Koch</li><li>Birth Year: 1843</li><li>Birth date: December 11, 1843</li><li>Birth City: Clausthal</li><li>Birth Country: Germany</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Prussian physician Robert Koch is best known for isolating the bacterium which causes tuberculosis, the cause of numerous deaths in the mid-19th century.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li>Science and Medicine</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Occupations</li><ul class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li>Medical Professional</li><li>Biologist</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1910</li><li>Death date: May 27, 1910</li><li>Death City: Baden-Baden</li><li>Death Country: Germany</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=43><ul data-node-id=45 class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li>Article Title: Robert Koch Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/scientists/robert-koch</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: September 12, 2022</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiqnKGVo8Gqv9OsZqunkpq%2FtXnKqJqh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./8-celebrities-with-exotic-animals-pet-tigers-monkeys-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>8 celebrities with exotic animals (Pet tigers, monkeys and more)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-landman-net-worth-246578.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Landman Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
