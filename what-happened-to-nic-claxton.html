Putting aside the fact the Denver fans were hilariously changing ‚Äúwhose your daddy‚Äù to LeBron and AD, the ring itself is amazing. The ring has 16 carats of diamonds representing Denver‚Äôs 16 playoff wins. The ring also has two special features. The first is that the Larry O‚ÄôBrien trophy is actually a hidden lever, which shifts the year from 1967, the year the Nuggets were founded, to 2023, while also changing the background from diamonds to sapphires. The ring also has a smaller ring inside of it which looks like the championship banner. This is one of the better rings in recent memory. The Bucks ring in 2021 could turn into a necklace, the Warriors in 2022 could be twisted to reveal a hidden compartment with how many trophies each player had won and the Raptors in 2019 was just insane. Where do you rank this championship ring?</p><p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - HoopsByHarry" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì HoopsByHarry</a></p><p><a href=#>Nic Claxton‚Äôs Return Boosts Brooklyn Nets‚Äô Defense and Offense</a>.&nbsp;Nic Claxton, the talented center for the Brooklyn Nets, has made a triumphant return to the court after an eight-game absence due to a left ankle injury.
