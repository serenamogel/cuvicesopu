Although it is unclear if the singer ever mentioned Aguilera by name, she did, however, go as far as to say that Lil Kim and Mya “were nice.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Pink and Aguilera’s years-long feud stemmed from who would do the lead vocals in the hit single, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post.</a>&nbsp;Things got so bad between the pair that it is reported Aguilera tried to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">punch Pink during an outing</a>. But over the years, it appeared that the alleged beef between both women had settled until Pink’s February interview. Since then, Pink has responded to those remarks about her dodgy comments and claimed that she isn’t <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“shading” anyone</a>, but simply recounting the experience as it happened.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>This particular topic made fans more interested in all aspects of Pink’s life, including her diet. This article will dig deep into the “Who Knew” vocalist’s lifestyle and answer those die-hard questions, such as if Pink <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is vegan</a> or vegetarian.</p><h2 id=h-is-pink-vegan-or-vegetarian data-injectable=false>Is Pink vegan or vegetarian?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by P!NK (@pink)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false><br>Although Pink has confirmed in the past that she was vegetarian since she was 15, during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food & Wine,</a>&nbsp;the mother of two said that all changed when she gave birth to her daughter Willow Hart. Pink told the publication in May 2017:</p><p>“I haven’t eaten anything four-legged or cute since I was 15. I had also stopped eating chicken, but when my daughter, Willow, was in my belly, she just demanded chicken wings and fingers.”</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Pink’s sentiments towards her flexible diet were also confirmed during a discussion with Fitness Magazine. The “Just Give Me a Reason” songstress shared that she tries to keep a well-balanced diet “most of the time” by consuming plant-based meals when she is off-tour. She does mention, however, that she occasionally eats chicken and fish:</p><p>“I try to eat really healthy most of the time. When I’m not on tour, I’ve done the vegan thing, although I sometimes eat chicken and fish.”</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>In recent years, Pink has shown off vegan recipes of cuisines she’s made after discovering her son Jameson Hart’s food allergies. Hart is allergic to eggs, dairy, and wheat. In a May 2020 Instagram video, Pink <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded a video showcasing the process of her making a vegan cherry tart.</a> The ingredients included cherries from the singer’s cherry tree in her backyard, vegan graham crackers, vegan butter, and coconut yogurt for filling alongside vanilla extract and brown sugar.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>At this time, it is unclear if Pink is still consuming animal-based products.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnPoqWkZaaatKK6jKipZq6VnLK1rdGimKdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-dribble-dribble-song-tiktok-jiggle-jiggle-lyrics-meaning-290932-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Is Dribble Dribble Song TikTok?
