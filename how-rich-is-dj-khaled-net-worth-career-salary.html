On Thursday, July 28, the record producer turned to Instagram, posting footage of himself clutching many lottery tickets for the forthcoming lottery, which is expected to feature a $1.02 billion grand prize.&nbsp;Netizens were dissatisfied with the decision and chastised the artist on Twitter, claiming he had wrecked the odds for everyone.</p><p>On Tuesday, July 26, no winning Mega Millions lottery tickets were sold. This lifted the threshold from the previous prize of $830 million to the present sum.&nbsp;DJ Khaled advertised his forthcoming album God Did in an Instagram video, showing off his Mega Million lottery tickets and saying:</p><p>‚ÄúI hope you played because I did.‚Äù It‚Äôs a billion bucks, I‚Äôm going to try. You see what‚Äôs going on, Mega Millions. I‚Äôm not messing around with this. I hope you had fun because I did. They don‚Äôt believe in us, but God does.‚Äù</p><p>In the caption, DJ Khaled also wrote:</p><p>‚ÄúDid you receive yours? Are you focused? I AM!‚Äù ‚Äù #GODDID!‚Äù</p><h2>DJ Khaled‚Äôs net worth</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, DJ Khaled is one of the most successful artists in the business, with a net worth of $75 million as of August 2023. Along with his large income, the rapper is a regular on Forbes‚Äô Hip Hop Cash Kings list. However, the gifted artist‚Äôs life was not always like this. DJ Khaled stated in a 2016 interview with Complex magazine that he and his family were financially suffering at one time, forcing him to sleep in his vehicle. During the interview, he stated:</p><p>‚ÄúGod has provided me with the ability to appreciate the finer things in life.‚Äù I‚Äôve watched my family work so hard and rise, just to have it all ripped away. I had to man up, which included sleeping in my vehicle, renting an apartment for a month, and then being evicted the next month. Staying in $25-$35 hotel rooms. I just never panicked. I kept concentrating and never gave up.‚Äù</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DJ-Khaled-2.jpg alt="DJ Khaled" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say that he now has the wherewithal to care for his parents, wife, other family members, and his staff, whom he considers to be family as well.&nbsp;DJ Khaled‚Äôs meteoric rise started in the 1990s when he worked as a DJ for Miami radio station 99 Jamz. His popularity with his radio program led to his being hired as a DJ by Terror Squad.&nbsp;He went on to curate his own albums after getting massive attention. Listennn‚Ä¶ the Record, the 46-year-first old‚Äôs album, was published in 2006.
