He wanted to be a hero and helped the Titans save Gotham City from Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow (Vincent Kartheiser) and his reign of terror. For his efforts, Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Brenton Thwaites) permitted Tim Drake to join the team and train as the new Robin, and he traveled with them on their trip to Metropolis.</p><h2 id=h-tim-drake-and-bernard-s-story data-injectable=false>Tim Drake and Bernard’s story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Robin-Bernard-Titans.jpg><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=716 data-injectable=true>In Titans season four, episode one, “Lex Luthor,” the Titans visit S.T.A.R. Labs in Metropolis after a message is sent to Conner Kent/Superboy (Joshua Orpin) to meet him there. Although <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superman was called away to an important mission</a>, the team was introduced to Bernard Fitzmartin (James Scully), the Director of Special Projects at S.T.A.R. Labs, and from the moment Tim met Bernard they were smitten.</p><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=576 data-injectable=true>The team takes a tour around S.T.A.R. Labs and their abilities are tested with top-of-the-line equipment. This facility acts as a home base of sorts in this season of Titans, and Bernard their main point of contact. He’s been helping them figure out what’s happening with Mother Mayhem (Franka Potente) and her interest in Sebastian Sanger/Brother Blood (Joseph Morgan), and he’s been spending quality time helping Tim Drake train to become the new Robin. Nightwing has prevented the heroic hopeful from getting too involved in battle until he’s ready.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>passing the (metaphorical) baton.</p><p>the first two episodes of <a href=#>#dctitans</a> season 4, part 1 are now streaming on <a href=#>@hbomax</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OvORoo8Gum</a></p>— DC Titans (@DCTitans) <a href=#>November 3, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>In episode three, “Jinx,” Tim tests out his retractable bo staff against Conner in a VR simulation to test his skills. Of course, his physical attacks are useless against the Kryptonian, and Tim and Conner start trash-talking one another. Bernard has to step and get them to cut it out, and there’s some flirting between him and Tim between the action and bickering.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The kiss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Titans-team-season-4.jpg><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>Tim grows tired of standing on the sidelines and wants in on the action with the rest of the team. In episode five, “Inside Man,” Tim and Bernard are on monitor duty, watching S.T.A.R. Labs in case Mother Mayhem comes for Sebastian. Bernard reminds him that Dick says this job requires deep commitment and sacrifice and Tim has to really want this before he jumps in. Bernard adds that he believes in Tim and that he’ll know his moment when it comes.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Tim and Bernard’s monitoring pays off when they notice a snake in the laboratory — like the snake that killed Lex Luthor. Tim rushes out to investigate before Bernard can stop him, and when they find it chases after them through the hallway. They narrowly escape, hide in a room, and share a meaningful stare as they hold the doors closed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>every robin has to start somewhere 👊 <a href=#>#dctitans</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GnWENsc32z</a></p>— DC Titans (@DCTitans) <a href=#>November 11, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Superboy has been cursed and his body’s been taken over by a snake thanks to Mother Mayhem.

Only, Superboy vomits up the snake and it starts attacking the team. Tim Drake steps up and uses his bo staff and smashes its head in before it strikes Bernard, saving his life. He finally found his moment. In private,</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>Tim thanks Bernard for his words of encouragement and Bernard tells him that the snake didn’t stand a chance against him.

This is also where Titans got Bernard’s “Fitzmartin” name from. Bernard was a former classmate of Tim who had harsh parents that expected too much from him. Bernard liked having fun, he preferred video games to schoolwork and he became passionate about Robin and his heroism — despite not knowing that the hero behind the mask was Tim.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>"I love this character very much, and as I went back to reread as much as I could to do Robin justice, it became clear this is the story Tim needed to tell."<a href=#>@megfitz89</a> discusses Tim Drake's major moment in Batman: Urban Legends #6 with <a href=#>@Polygon</a>: <a href=#>https://t.co/qDt1K8P6GK</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/t6olKJFZDG</a></p>— DC Nation (@thedcnation) <a href=#>August 11, 2021</a></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Robin has been investigating teen kidnappings in Gotham City with no obvious pattern between them.
