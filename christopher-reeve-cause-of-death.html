He planned to go to New York City to find a career in theatre.&nbsp;</p><p>When Christopher Reeve&nbsp;fell from his horse&nbsp;he landed directly on his helmet, in a near perpendicular position, breaking two vertebrae in his neck. His spinal cord was not completely severed, but there was a large haemorrhage at the point of the injury.</p><p>On May 27, 1995, Reeve’s horse made a refusal. Witnesses said that the horse began the third fence jump and suddenly stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, holding on to the reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse.&nbsp;</p><p>He landed head first on the far side of the fence, shattering his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from the neck down, also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs.</p><p>He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Because of Reeve’s injury, Armand Assante replaced him in the role of Alan&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Breck Stewart</a>&nbsp;in Kidnapped.</p><p>His father is F. D. Reeve(father).</p><p>Reeve’s father was a Princeton University graduate studying for a master’s degree in Russian at Columbia University before Christopher’s birth. Despite being born wealthy, Franklin Reeve spent summers working at the docks with longshoremen.</p><p>Reeve’s mother had been a student at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, but transferred to Barnard College to be closer to Franklin, whom she had met through a family connection. They had another son, Benjamin, born on October 6, 1953.</p><p>He has four siblings.</p><p>His&nbsp;spouse&nbsp;is Dana Morosini</p><p>Dana Charles Reeve&nbsp;was an American actress, singer, and activist for disability causes. She was the wife of actor Christopher Reeve and mother of television reporter and anchor Will Reeve.</p><p>His widow,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Dana Reeve</a>, headed the Christopher Reeve Foundation after his death. Although a non-smoker, she was diagnosed with lung cancer on August 9, 2005, and it was speculated that it came from being in smoky bars. She died at age&nbsp;44 on March 6, 2006.</p><p>She died just&nbsp;17 months&nbsp;after her husband, actor Christopher Reeve.</p><p>Christopher&nbsp;had three&nbsp;children: Matthew Exton&nbsp;Reeve, an activist, Alexandra Exton&nbsp;Reeve, and William&nbsp;Reeve.&nbsp;</p><p>He had a net worth of&nbsp;$10 million&nbsp;at the time of his death in 2004.</p><p>&nbsp;According to numerology, his Life Path Number is 6.&nbsp;He&nbsp;is a celebrity Actor, Author, Television producer, Voice Actor, Film director, Screenwriter, Film Producer.</p><p>Star of 1978’s&nbsp;Superman&nbsp;who was tragically paralyzed in a 1995 horse-riding accident.
