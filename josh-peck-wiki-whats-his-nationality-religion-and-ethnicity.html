He has addressed his beliefs in a number of interviews. Since he was a child, Peck has wished to be a part of a Jewish community. In an interview, Peck stated that he has always grappled with his Jewish identity because he grew up in an interfaith family.</p><p>His mother is Jewish and was reared Orthodox, whilst his father was raised agnostic in an interfaith environment. Josh also stated that his parents raised him and his brothers without any religious instruction. As a result, he never went to the temple until he was visiting his mother’s relatives.</p><p>When Peck was about 9 or 10 years old, his mother enrolled him and his sister in a Jewish religious day school on weekends. Meanwhile, they never returned after Josh was humiliated by a Hershey’s chocolate bar melting all over his clothes. A few years later, they went to another temple.

Many individuals have praised Josh and his family as excellent examples of Jewish and interfaith families.</p><h2>Josh Peck Ethnicity and Nationality</h2><p>Josh Peck was born into a mixed-race family. Peck’s mother is of Orthodox Jewish heritage, therefore he has Jewish ancestors on his mother’s side. His father comes from a mixed family, with a Jewish grandmother and a Catholic grandfather.
