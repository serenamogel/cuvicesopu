Continue reading to learn more about Charissa Thompson’s phone hack and other details surrounding the incident.</p><h2>What Happened to Charissa Thompson After Her Phone Was Hacked?</h2><p>People are curious about the Charissa Thompson Phone Hack. Thompson’s iCloud account was compromised earlier this year, and private photos from her account were made public online. Thompson is currently an NFL commentator for Fox Sports. Thompson didn’t sugarcoat the truth that it had been a horrible, horrible event for her.</p><p>Thompson also revealed how a man was discovered in her California home by a house-sitter named Ryen Russillo, who was waiting for his apartment to be ready, rather than by her or the police, to demonstrate how her safety and privacy had been violated. Fox Sports is a sports channel.</p><p>As a result of hacking, Charissa Thompson was the victim of a planned release of content via her iPhone around a year ago. Private images and films were, in any case, uploaded on the internet. When Charissa’s attorney sent a cease-and-desist letter, the X-rated photos and video were swiftly deleted from the internet.</p><p>Charissa is pursuing the websites that are posting the film now that it has resurfaced on the internet, while authorities investigate. The most recent message, which was leaked in January, appears to be the work of the original hacker.</p><h2>Charissa Thompson’s Personal Life</h2><p>Thompson currently resides in Malibu, California. She proposed to sports agent Kyle Thousand in January 2020. She and Thousand will tie the knot on December 30, 2020. It was reported after a year that they would divorce in April 2022. She married for the second time when she was 25 years old.</p><p>She also dated former Chicago Bulls player and ESPN analyst Jay Williams. Thompson clarified on her Wikipedia page in 2019 that, contrary to what the previous article stated, she was not a trapeze artist. Thompson’s naked images were leaked online in January 2018 as a result of an iCloud account theft. Thompson immediately filed a lawsuit.</p><p><strong>“When it comes to your physical being and intimate photos between you and your boyfriend and things that you sent to someone when you were in a long-distance relationship and love, it is your private property,” she told The Athletic in a June interview. It appeared to be an invasion for obvious reasons.”</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
