He is a well-known spokesman and television personality, perhaps best known for incredible weight loss and for advertising the “Subway” restaurants. Now Fogle is involved in a scandal related to child pornography, and this has made his name regularly mentioned in the media. Jared is now 38 years old, but his career is in great danger as he has pleaded guilty and is to be sentenced in November 2015. It may take a long time until he regains the popularity he had.</p><p>If you consider how rich Jared Fogle is, it can be said that Jared’s estimated net worth is $15 million. The main source of this sum of money is his collaboration with the “Subway” restaurant chain. What is more, he also gained quite a lot of money when he had a career in television. Although Jared is now involved in a scandal, there is still a chance that his net worth will become higher in the future.</p><h3>Jared Fogle Subway Net Worth $15 Million</h3><p>Jared studied at the North Central High School and later continued his studies at Indiana University. After graduating Jared started working at American Trans Air; it was the time when Jared Fogle’s net worth began growing. In 1999 Jared’s name became known to the media as his story about a significant weight loss was published in the newspaper, “Indiana Daily Student”. Later his story also appeared in “Men’s Health”, and this added a lot to his net worth. The story was mainly about how Jared was able to lose a lot of weight by eating “Subway” sandwiches, so there is no surprise that soon the “Subway” restaurants became interested in Fogle and his story. After some time they started an advertising campaign which gained a lot attention. This had a huge impact on the growth of Jared’s net worth. Soon he started appearing in more commercials and even travelled around the United States representing “Subway” restaurants.</p><p>As Jared became more and more famous he decided to create his own foundation, called “The Jared Foundation”, which helped to fight childhood obesity. Unfortunately, his collaboration with the “Subway” restaurants ended when he was accused of child pornography. His foundation also stopped its activities as the director of this foundation, Russell Taylor was also accused of child pornography. Jared’s sentencing hearing is in November, and there is a posibility that he will be jailed.</p><p>If to talk about Jared Fogle’s personal life, it can be said that in 2001 he married Elizabeth Christie, but they divorced in 2007. In 2010 he married Katie McLaughin, with whom he has two children. Unfortunately, after Jared’s scandal he and Katie separated. All in all, it can be said that Jared is quite a controversial personality, whose career at first seemed perfect but now it has shattered into small pieces.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=25.569082672707><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jared Fogle</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1 December 1977,</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Indianapolis, Indiana USA</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Height</td><td>1.87&nbsp;m, 1.87&nbsp;m, 1.87&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Profession</td><td>TV Personality, Writer, Spokesperson, TV Personality, Writer, Spokesperson, TV Personality, Writer, Spokesperson</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Education</td><td>North Central High School, Indiana University Bloomington, North Central High School, Indiana University Bloomington, North Central High School, Indiana University Bloomington</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American,</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Spouse</td><td>Katie McLaughlin, Elizabeth Fogle, Katie McLaughlin, Elizabeth Fogle, Katie McLaughlin, Elizabeth Fogle</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Children</td><td>Brady Fogle, Quinn Fogle, Brady Fogle, Quinn Fogle, Brady Fogle, Quinn Fogle</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Parents</td><td>Norman Fogle, Adrienne Fogle, Norman Fogle, Adrienne Fogle, Norman Fogle, Adrienne Fogle</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Subway Guy,</td></tr><tr readability=0.44444444444444><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.facebook.com/jared.fogle</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1815678</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>full-movie.us/tag/Jared Fogle,</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=3><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>I had no intention of anyone ever finding out what I had done.
