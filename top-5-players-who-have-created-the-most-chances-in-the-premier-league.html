Because of their ability to change the course of the game with a single pass, creative players are in high demand in today’s market.</p><p>Such players have a magical touch to their play. World-class creators are known for their exceptional vision, passing, technical ability, and ability to break down a defense.</p><p>We look at the five Premier League players who have created the most chances so far (2021/22).</p><h2>Number 5: Matt Ritchie – 25 chances</h2><p>Given Newcastle United’s poor form this season, many will be surprised to see <strong>Matt Ritchie</strong>‘s name on this list.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matt-Ritchie.jpg><p>Ritchie has been a player for a long time, making him a seasoned campaigner. To nearly £11 million, the Scotland international moved to Newcastle United from Bournemouth in 2016. Though he initially made his name as a winger, Newcastle United has recently used Ritchie in the back line.</p><p>The 32-year-old is a dependable player who excels at the crossing and taking set pieces. Newcastle United’s new manager, Eddie Howe, knows all about Ritchie’s abilities from their time together at Bournemouth.</p><h2>Number 4: Mohamed Salah – 26 chances</h2><p>Mohamed Salah has been the best player in the world this season, and his attacking prowess has single-handedly blown opponents away.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mohamed-Salah-5.jpg><p>Salah has been a world-class performer since joining Liverpool, but he has stepped up this season. With his speed, dribbling, and finishing ability, the 29-year-old has terrorized opposing defenders. So far this season, he has thrived as both a scorer and a creator.</p><p>Salah has been outstanding for Jurgen Klopp’s team. The Egypt international has ten goals and seven assists in 11 Premier League appearances. With his contract expiring in 2023, Liverpool fans want him to sign a new contract with the club as soon as possible.</p><h2>Number&nbsp; 3: Jack Grealish – 26 Chances</h2><p><strong>Jack Grealish</strong> has yet to replicate the form that drew Manchester City to pay nearly £106 million for him from Aston Villa this summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jack-Grealish.jpeg><p>Grealish’s talent is undeniable. The 26-year-old is a fantastic dribbler and chance creator, and he was Aston Villa’s superstar and talisman. Moving to Manchester City has understandably reduced his importance, but Grealish has shown glimpses of his potential.</p><p>The England international has appeared in nine Premier League games, scoring one goal and assisting on two others. Grealish is still figuring out Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s style of play. The forward should improve with time for his new club.</p><h2>Number 2: Trent Alexander-Arnold – 30 Chances</h2><p><strong>Trent Alexander- Arnold</strong>‘s has been waxed lyrical about. Many consider him a generational footballer capable of making a significant impact on the right-back position.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Trent-Alexander-Arnold-2.jpg><p>Alexander-Arnold, a Liverpool academy product, is a one-club man. Since making his debut in 2016, the 23-year-old has quickly established himself as the team’s most inventive player. Alexander-Arnold is a world-class forward, with praise for his passing, crossing, and technical ability.</p><p>The England international, a dead-ball specialist, is widely regarded as the best right-back in the world. Last season, Alexander-performances Arnold’s was criticized, but the young superstar has recovered well. He has one goal and four assists in nine Premier League games.</p><h2>Number 1:&nbsp; Bruno Fernandes – 37 Chances</h2><p>The fewer words about Manchester United’s season thus far, the better. The pressure is mounting on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and even <strong>Bruno Fernandes</strong> has been chastised for his performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bruno-Fernandes.jpg><p>Fernandes is a one-of-a-kind footballer. The Portugal international, a world-class creator and prolific goalscorer, has had a transformative effect on the club since his arrival. The midfielder, a firm fan favorite among the Old Trafford faithful, has frequently been the difference between a win and a loss under Solskjaer’s management.</p><p>Despite some underwhelming performances this season, Fernandes is still the club’s most important player. The 27-year-old has appeared in 11 Premier League games, scoring four goals and assisting on three others.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqxuMCynKurXay1sHnHmq2eZZOnsqLAxJ1kraCVYrqwv9NmmqGZnpiytHnIp2StoJVivbOxzKKcq2Wcmq6owcRo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./danica-patrick-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Danica Patrick Net Worth Media &amp;amp; Book Publications</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./baltoy-ancient-origins-31.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Baltoy (Ancient Origins 31) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
