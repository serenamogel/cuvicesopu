AS Monaco FC is based in Monaco (the 2nd-smallest sovereign state in the world (with a total landmass of just 0.78 square miles), after Vatican City) but the club plays in the French soccer league system and is one of the most successful clubs there. With FC Basel, Breel won the Swiss Super League (the top tier of the Swiss soccer league system) title for 3 seasons in a row – 2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16. In the last of those seasons, he was named the league’s ‘Player of the Year’. At the international level, he represented Switzerland at the under-16, under-20, and under-21 tiers before making his senior national debut in March 2015.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Breel Donald Embolo</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Donald</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Breel-Embolo-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-July-2022.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Aquarius</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Yaoundé, Cameroon</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Basel City, Switzerland</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=Swiss src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Switzerland.png alt=Swiss width=64 height=44 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Professional Soccer Player</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Switzerland.png><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Father</strong> – Moise Kegni</li><li><strong>Mother</strong> – Germaine Embolo</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – He has a brother.</li><li><strong>Others</strong>&nbsp;– He has a stepfather.</li></ul><h3>Shirt Number</h3><ul><li>15, 7, 3 – Switzerland</li><li>36 – FC Basel, FC Schalke 04, Borussia Mönchengladbach, AS Monaco FC</li></ul><h3>Playing Position</h3><p>Forward</p><h3>Build</h3><p>Athletic</p><h3>Height</h3><p>6 ft 2 in or 188 cm</p><h3>Weight</h3><p>88 kg or 194 lbs</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Breel-Embolo-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-September-2022.jpg><h3>Girlfriend / Spouse</h3><p>Breel has dated –</p><li><strong>Naomi </strong>(2017-Present) – Breel began dating a Swiss model named Naomi in 2017.

When he was about 5 years old, his mother moved to France for further education. There, she&nbsp;met her future husband, a Swiss national. About a year later, she moved to Basel, Switzerland, with him, Breel, and Breel’s brother.</li><li>His youth career began in 2006 when, as a 9-year-old, he joined a local team called FC Nordstern Basel. In 2008, he joined the youth team of BSC Old Boys, a Swiss sports club based in Basel.</li><li>In 2010, Breel was selected by the youth system of FC Basel, the 2nd most successful professional soccer club in Switzerland. With the club’s youth teams, he won the under-16 Swiss championship in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. He was named ‘FC Basel Young Player of the Year’ in 2013. Breel stayed in the club’s youth system until 2014 when he was promoted to the senior team.</li><li>Owing to his birth in Cameroon and his long-term residence in Switzerland, he was eligible to represent both those countries at the international level. Between 2012 and 2013, he played 4 matches for the Swiss national under-16 team. Breel received Swiss citizenship in December 2014 after which he pledged his international allegiance to Switzerland.</li><li>In 2015, aged just 18, he established the ‘Embolo Foundation’ to help refugee children in Switzerland as well as underprivileged youth in Cameroon.</li><li>In October 2016, while representing German club FC Schalke 04, he suffered a serious injury that involved a complicated ankle fracture, ruptured syndesmosis (a fibrous joint in which 2 adjacent bones are linked by a strong membrane or ligaments), and medial collateral ligament damage. This ruled him out of action for the remainder of the season and he next played a competitive soccer match only in September 2017.</li><li>In October 2021, Breel scored 2 goals in Borussia Mönchengladbach‘s shock 5–0 win over FC Bayern Munich, the most successful club in German soccer history. The match was a part of the 2nd round of the season’s&nbsp;DFB-Pokal (the premier domestic knockout soccer competition in Germany). This was FC Bayern Munich‘s then-biggest defeat in the competition’s history and their first-ever elimination in the tournament at the hands of Borussia Mönchengladbach.</li><li>In Switzerland’s opening group stage match of the 2022 edition of the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) World Cup, against Cameroon, Breel scored the only goal of the game. This made Breel the first player in the history of the tournament to have scored a goal for his adopted country against his country of birth. Out of respect for his native Cameroon, he did not celebrate the goal.</li><li>In Switzerland’s last group stage match of the tournament, against Serbia, he scored the goal that leveled the match at 2 goals apiece. Switzerland went on to win the match by a 3-2 margin which helped them finish 2nd (with 6 points) in the 4-team group and qualify for the pre-quarterfinal stage of the tournament.</li><li>In a bittersweet situation for Breel, his adopted country (Switzerland) advanced to the next round of the tournament while Cameroon, his country of birth, finished 3rd (4 points) in that group and was knocked out of the competition. This was despite Cameroon defeating 5-time champions Brazil by a 1-0 margin in its final group stage match.</li><p>Featured Image by Breel Embolo / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpupnp2cYrKurs6lpmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./galax-and-kfa2-list-geforce-gtx-1070-katana-a-singleslot-geforce-gtx-1070.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Single-Slot GTX 1070 GPUs Coming Soon</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-noah-baumbachs-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Noah Baumbachs net worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
