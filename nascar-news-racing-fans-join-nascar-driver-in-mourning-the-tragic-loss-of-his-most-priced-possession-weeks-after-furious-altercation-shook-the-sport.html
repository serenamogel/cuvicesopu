However, technology has advanced to such levels that it looks to provide the closest possible feeling to driving a real car. Twitch content creator and sim racer Travis ‘Moonhead’ Brown can attest to that. Broadcasting his skills on iRacing, the leading racing sim platform, Travis has already made a name in the NASCAR industry. Having streamed <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dale Earnhardt Jr</a> racing at Talladega on the sim with him on the broadcast mic, he also has connections with the big boys.</p><p>Partnering up with Huffman Racing for this season, Brown was included in the racing roster at the famous Hickory Motor Speedway. Travis joined Landon Huffman in the ranks, who endures yet another tough week after a scuffle earlier. But it seems his latest drive fell short of his expectations, becoming a nightmare.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Landon Huffman Mourns the Loss of His Beloved Car, Calls It ‘Officially Over’</h2><p>The Huffman family holds great importance at Hickory. Landon himself is the reigning champion of the track. Moreover, his father, Robert Huffman, is a two-time champion at the venue as well. One of the most prized and valuable belongings of the family is the modified car, Frances. Unfortunately, it looks like Hickory was Frances’s last dance on the asphalt.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Frances is a complete waste. No saving it. I am sad but racecars are replaceable.</p><p>Travis is at the ER right now & im no expert but I’d say he is concussed at the very least. Hoping all checks out okay. <a href=#>https://t.co/oanptDnCGq</a></p><p>— Landon Huffman (@LandonHuffman) <a href=#>June 13, 2023</a></p><p>Giving Travis Brown an opportunity sadly proved to be disastrous. A broken throttle led to the car being unable to handle the pressure on the pedal. The sheer force translated into chaos in the car as the images shared by Huffman show. Although Travis has taken responsibility and said maybe it was his fault to exert too much on the pedal, the car looks doomed enough.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just past the flagstand felt a pop on throttle, let off and she was wide open. Don’t really know other than that, looking at the throttle cable and air cleaner it didn’t hang there and there obviously haven’t been previous issues. Feels like I put too much pressure on the pedal & <a href=#>https://t.co/ZJKCB4LWt7</a></p><p>— Moonhead (@itsmoonhead) <a href=#>June 13, 2023</a></p><p>Brown has been a part of the team in 2022 as well and gets along well with Huffman, who is a great sim racer as well.</p><p>Travis has also shared his remorse through Twitter. He explains the situation from his point of view and how the incident went under. Fortunately, he has not been involved in any extreme injuries and is out of any impending danger. The incident will act as a caution sign for Travis, who has also signed up to work with Alpha Prime Racing in the Xfinity Series.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>NASCAR Issues Long Ban on Racer’s Husband After Assault on Landon Huffman’s Father</h2><p>Hickory Motor Speedway was witness to some unsightly events two weeks back. Female driver Annabeth Barnes Crum and Huffman got into a mid-race tussle on the track. With very few laps left, Crum was the one who started the kerfuffle, trying to clamp Huffman into the wall.</p><p>But then Landon took control and did a bump-and-run with her that brought a failed retaliation from Crum. Seeing this, Annabeth’s husband, Jake, who was also her spotter, went and allegedly attacked Robert Huffman.</p><p>Huffman said that when he arrived at the scene, Robert was already severely bruised and wounded. But, this is not all NASCAR has taken strict action against. Jake Crum was acting as Barnes’s spotter without a license. It seems he will also be unable to get a NASCAR license until 2024. With NASCAR taking quick decisions on such things this season, everyone could have seen this coming.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Robert Huffman charges Jake Crum with assault. NASCAR suspends Crum. Crum has now charged Huffman back with assault. Hickory remains silent.</p><p>The latest:<a href=#>https://t.co/X5aJZCurFz</a></p><p>— Short Track Scene (@ST_Scene) <a href=#>May 27, 2023</a></p><p>The altercation between the two makes the situation even worse for Huffman, who will be concerned with the condition of Frances this week.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>7 worst wrecks involving Ross Chastain that proved detrimental to his rivals</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue82aqpyZomK7psPSZqmam5mjtG6ywKeqZqKfnrtuusCsmpqqXZm%2FqsLEq2Sipl2ivLa%2BzaKloGWknbJuwNGanqKbXaG8tL%2BMqJ1moJmoeq670q1kqaqZmLKlec%2Boqqydo6i2sLqMsJyeo6NirqfAxKtkn62inry2v4yao62dopiutbXOp2SsoJ%2BkuG7Ax55krKifp8Fw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./despite-rhoa-fans-approval-porsha-may-have-ditched-her-iconic-short-hair.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Despite RHOA fans approval, Porsha may have ditched her iconic short hair Mon 10 January 202</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-page-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-249107-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Page Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
