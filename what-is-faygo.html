Whether it’s Johnny Russell’s country song classic extolling the virtues of “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rednecks, White Socks, and Blue Ribbon Beer</a>” or the Beastie Boys professing their love for beer-based cocktails with their song “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brass Monkey</a>,” the drink becomes a part of a musician’s identity. And no drink has become more integral to a musical group and its fanbase than Faygo. So, what is Faygo and why is it the preferred drink of the Insane Clown Posse?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-faygo><strong>What is Faygo?</strong></h2><p>Faygo was founded in 1907 by two Russian immigrant brothers, Ben and Perry Feigenson. Initially, the brand was called the Feigenson Bottle Works Co but, by 1921, they decided to change the name to Faygo, a consumer-friendly shortening of their last name. Bakers by trade, the Feigenson brothers created their soda flavors based on their icings; the first three flavors were fruit punch, strawberry, and grape.&nbsp;</p><p>The brand remained regional to the Detroit area until the 1950s, when the company began an aggressive marketing campaign. This included <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television commercials created by Jim Henson and his Muppets</a> and, later in the 1960s, advertising at Detroit Tigers games. These tactics propelled sales and helped Faygo reach a national audience.</p><p>The company was family-owned until 1986 when it was bought by TreeSweet products Corp and subsequently sold to National Beverage Corp in 1987, who also own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LaCroix</a> and Shasta.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-faygo-flavors-are-available-and-does-faygo-have-caffeine><strong>What Faygo flavors are available and does Faygo have caffeine?</strong></h2><p>Faygo really goes all-in on the fruit flavored sodas and, appropriately, they are quite insane. They continue to make their classic Fruit Punch, Grape, and Strawberry flavors, the latter of which has been rebranded simply to Redpop. Over time, they really expanded their selection with out-of-the-box flavors like Firework, Jazzin’ Bluesberry, Cotton Candy, Candy Apple, Rock & Rye, and 60/40 (a combination of grapefruit and lime), among others.</p><p>Their Root Beer flavor is quite popular and was recognized as one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best root beers in America according to Bon Appetit in 2009</a>. They also have a cola flavor and a Mountain Dew approximation called Moon Mist. These two and their variations are the only Faygo soda brands that have caffeine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Faygo also offers a subsidiary brand named Ohana which focuses on non-carbonated beverages like lemonades, iced teas, and other fruit juices.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-faygo-sold><strong>Where is Faygo sold?</strong></h2><p>While predominantly a Midwest brand, you can get Faygo pretty much anywhere. Their website has a handy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Faygo locator</a> that allows you to enter your zip code and find the Faygo nearest to you. There are also tons of online retailers that offer it for sale.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-the-icp-own-faygo><strong>Does the ICP own Faygo?</strong></h2><p>The Insane Clown Posse is a Detroit-based rap duo that often has proclaimed love for their hometown soda brand in their music. They are also a notorious music act that has developed a rabid fanbase called the Juggalo Nation. Fans and artists associated with ICP began bringing bottles of Faygo to performances, spraying each other with the soda, and throwing bottles into the crowd. Some people argue that the proliferation of the Juggalo Nation and the overall rise in popularity of Faygo coincide.</p><p>Sadly, ICP does not own Faygo, and the brand has kept them at arm’s length in regards to acknowledging the association. Perhaps it is due to ICP’s knack for attracting controversy with some of their more extreme, violent lyrics and the fanatical devotion of their fans that led the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI to classify them as a gang</a>. However, it’s this author’s opinion that, like many fringe sub-cultures, the Juggalos are simply misunderstood; the group actually promotes inclusion and anti-bigotry, focusing more on their chosen “family.” They just happen to also dress up like murder clowns. What’s so wrong with that?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmnZqxl6R8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jascha-washington.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jascha Washington movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-unlock-the-le-sserafim-skins-in-overwatch-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to unlock the LE SSERAFIM skins in Overwatch 2</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./largest-islands-in-the-world.html>Largest Islands in the World: The Largest Islands You Need to See</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./natalia-natchan.html>Natalia Natchan</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./trader-joes-vegan-korean-bulgagi-news.html>People Are Loving Trader Joe's New Vegan Korean BBQ Product</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./irrational-man-2015.html>Irrational Man movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gina-carano-reportedly-asked-pedro-pascal-firing-talk-disney.html>Gina Carano Reportedly Asked Pedro Pascal To Talk To Disney After Her Firing</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaDash.
